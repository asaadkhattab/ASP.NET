# VialSnap
## User-Friendly Pharmaceutical Progressive Web App
### http://www.vialsnap.com
This app helps pharmacists and technicians manage their patient's perscriptions, organize the drug inventory, and make payments. 
I worked at CVS as a pharmacy technician and I didn't like their RxConnect System. Not only does their dull gray-bluish screen put you to 
sleep, but their system is frustrating, the user face isn't friendly, the GUI is bad, and navigating it is tedious. 
Did you know that they don't use a mouse so they can calculate the employee's efficiency by recording the keystrokes? Well, I think that 
is very inefficient.
VialSnap will have a slick interface.  

I named it Vialsnap because finally will technicians be able to do get their work done in a 'snap'. Vial is the orange container for the 
tablets and pills. So the our system is fast and effiecient opening one of those non-saftey caps on a vial.
